DnB, D&B, Drum and Bass -> Drum & Bass;\r\n    Alt., Altern, Alterneitif -> Alternative\r\n    * Splits tags in various applicable ways, eg.\r\n    Jazz/Funk&Rock -> Jazz, Funk, Rock;\r\n    Alternative Rock -> Alternative, Rock\r\n    * Uses a whitelist to avoid crappy tags (see\r\n    [genres.txt](wlg/data/genres.txt))\r\n    * Scores tags while taking personal preferences into account\r\n  * Caches all data received from music sites to make reruns super fast\r\n  * Uses MusicBrainz IDs for searching when available\r\n  * Optional: gets release type (Album, EP, Anthology, ...) from What.CD\r\n  (with interactivity mode for ambiguous results)\r\n  * Can be used as plugin in other software, currently:\r\n  [beets](https://github.com/sampsyo/beets)\r\n  * Dry-mode for safe testing\r\n\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\nIt scans through directories for albums and receives genre tags for them and\r\ntheir artists from selected music sites. Equal tags in different writings will\r\nbe split and/or merged to ensure consistent names and proper scoring. Artist\r\nand album tags get handled separately and then merged using configurable score\r\nmodifiers. The best scored tags will be saved as genre metadata in the\r\ncorresponding album tracks. All data received from music sites gets cached so\r\nthat rerunning the script will be super fast. There are several score\r\nmultipliers to adjust the scoring to your needs and take your personal\r\npreferences into account. Please take a look at \"Configuration options\r\nexplained\" below for more details.\r\n\r\n##### Tag scoring with count (What.CD artist, Last.FM, MusicBrainz, EchoNest terms)\r\nIf counts are supplied for the tags they will get scored by `count/topcount`,\r\nwhere `topcount` is the highest count of all tags from a source. So the top\r\ntag gets a score of `1.0`, a tag having only half of the top tag's count gets\r\na score of `0.5` and so on.\r\n\r\n##### Tag scoring without count (What.CD album, Discogs, EchoNest genres)\r\nTags supplied without a count will be scored `max(1/3, 0.85^(n-1))`, where `n`\r\nis the total number of tags supplied by this source. The more tags the lower\r\nthe score for each tag will be. So if only one tag is supplied, it will get a\r\nscore of `1.0`, two tags will get a score of `0.85` each and so on. The minimum\r\nscore is `1/3`, which applies if there are more than 7 tags supplied.\r\n\r\n##### Tag merging of artist and album tags\r\nAfter all tags have been gathered the scores of album and artist tags will be\r\nscaled and then merged together taking the artist score modifier option into\r\naccount. This enables that multiple albums from one artist get more equal tags\r\nby giving tags found by artist searches advantage over tags found by album\r\nsearches.\r\nSee `artist` score option below.\r\n\r\n##### Tag scoring for various artist albums without any specific album artist\r\nIf there is no specific album artist for a various artist album every track\r\nartist can get used for searching. Tags for artists that appear multiple times\r\nin that album get counted multiple times.\r\nSee `vaqueries` and `various` options below.\r\n\r\n##### Multiple value metadata and old ID3 versions\r\nMutagen's ID3 API is primary targeted at id3v2.4, so by default any id3 tags\r\nwill be upgraded to 2.4 and saving a file will make it 2.4 as well.\r\nSee [mutagen doc here]\r\n(https://mutagen.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html#id3-versions)\r\nfor details.\r\nHowever, if you don't want to use v2.4 tags you can use the `id3v23sep` config\r\noption explained below.\r\n\r\n##### Interactivity (while tagging releasetypes)\r\nSometimes a dataprovider returns more than one result of tags (eg. different\r\neditions of the same album or album and single with the same name). This is not\r\na problem since these results often contain very similar tags that can simply\r\nbe merged together. However, to tag releasetypes it is necessary to know the\r\nright result, so some user input might be required when the results have\r\ndifferent releasetypes, but several steps are taken to reduce needed\r\ninteractivity, like filtering by snatched flag (make sure to enable 'Snatched\r\ntorrents indicator' in your whatcd profile settings) or by year (if given).\r\n\r\nSo, interactivity is only needed for setting proper releasetypes\r\nin some ambiguous cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nYou'll need Python 2.7.\r\n\r\nInstall the dependencies with your package manager, on Debian based distros run\r\nthis as root:\r\n\r\n    apt-get install python-mutagen python-requests\r\n\r\n* Alternatively, install the dependencies using python-pip:\r\n`pip install mutagen requests`\r\n* Clone the repository or download and unzip the [source package]\r\n(http://github.com/YetAnotherNerd/whatlastgenre/archive/master.zip)\r\n* Run it without install by using `./whatlastgenre` from the directory you\r\ncloned/extracted to\r\n* Install it by running `python setup.py install` as root in that directory\r\n\r\n##### Optional dependencies\r\n* `rauth` is required for Discogs. If you want to use Discogs, install `rauth`\r\nwith pip like above and activate `discogs` in the config file (see below).\r\n* `requests-cache` can additionally cache the raw queries from requests if\r\ninstalled. This is mainly a developers feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\nA configuration file with default values will be created at\r\n`~/.whatlastgenre/config` on first run.\r\n\r\n### Example configuration file\r\n```\r\n[wlg]\r\nsources = whatcd, lastfm, discogs, mbrainz, echonest\r\nwhatcduser = whatusername\r\nwhatcdpass = whatpassword\r\nwhitelist =\r\nvaqueries = True\r\nid3v23_sep =\r\n[genres]\r\nlove = trip-rock\r\nhate = alternative, electronic, indie, pop, rock\r\n[scores]\r\nartist = 1.33\r\nvarious = 0.66\r\nsplitup = 0.33\r\nsrc_whatcd = 1.50\r\nsrc_lastfm = 0.66\r\nsrc_discogs = 1.00\r\nsrc_mbrainz = 0.66\r\nsrc_echonest = 1.00\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Configuration options explained\r\n\r\n#### whatlastgenre (wlg) section\r\n\r\n##### sources option\r\nThe music sites where to get the genre tags from.\r\n* `whatcd` [[URL](https://what.cd)]\r\nwell-kept tags from community\r\n* `lastfm` [[URL](http://last.fm)]\r\nmany personal tags from users\r\n* `discogs` [[URL](http://discogs.com)]\r\nalbum only, fixed list of [genres and styles]\r\n(http://www.discogs.com/help/doc/submission-guidelines-release-genres-styles),\r\nrequires authentication (own account needed)\r\n* `mbrainz` [[URL](http://musicbrainz.org)]\r\nhome of mbids\r\n* `echonest` [[URL](http://echonest.com)]\r\nartist only, genres without counts and terms with counts (see\r\n[doc](http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4/))\r\n\r\n##### whitelist option\r\nPath to your custom whitelist. Use [shipped whitelist](wlg/data/genres.txt)\r\nif empty (default). Make sure the aliases and replacements from\r\n[tags.txt](wlg/data/tags.txt) fit the used whitelist.\r\n\r\n##### vaqueries option\r\nSearch for all artists if there is no albumartist on albums with various\r\nartists. This will make queries for va-albums without albumartist take\r\nsignificantly longer, but yields more results. (Default: `True`)\r\nSee `various` score option below.\r\n\r\n##### id3v23sep option\r\nBy (mutagen) default all id3 v2.3 tags will be upgraded to v2.4. Since v2.3\r\ncan't store multiple value metadata you need to set a seperator if you intend\r\nto use old v2.3 tags (not recommended).\r\nSetting this to a non-empty value (for example `,`) will downgrade all id3 tags\r\nto v2.3 and store all genres in one tag seperated by `id3v23sep` instead of\r\nusing v2.4 tags that can have multiple values. Empty by defaut.\r\nYou should upgrade your other software to support id3v24 instead of using this.\r\n\r\n#### genres section\r\n\r\n##### love and hate options\r\nList of tags that get a multiplier bonus of `2.0` and `0.5` respectively.\r\nShould be considered as \"soft white-/blacklist\" where you can in-/decrease the\r\noccurrence of specific tags that you don't like or that are too inaccurate for\r\nyou without fully banning them.\r\n\r\n#### scores section\r\n\r\n##### artist option\r\nScore multiplier to give tags found by albumartist searches advantage over tags\r\nfrom album searches. The tags get stored separately at first but then put\r\ntogether while taking this multiplier into account. This enables that multiple\r\nalbums from one artist get more equal tags.\r\n\r\n`<artist tags> * <artist score> + <album tags>`\r\n\r\nDefault `1.33`, Range `0.5 - 2.0`\r\n* `< 1.0` prefer album tags\r\n* `= 1.0` handle them equally\r\n* `> 1.0` prefer artist tags\r\n\r\n##### various option\r\nScore multiplier similar to the artist option, but this one applies to various\r\nartists releases if there is no albumartist and all the track artists get used\r\nfor searching, which can be controlled with the `vaqueries` option (see above).\r\nFor example: a 5 track va-album with 3 tracks from artist A and 2 tracks from\r\nartist B will get tags like this:\r\n\r\n`(3 * <artist A tags> + 2 * <artist B tags>) * <various score> + <album tags>`\r\n\r\nDefault `0.66`, Range `0.1 - 1.0`\r\n* `< 1.0` prefer album tags\r\n* `= 1.0` handle them equally\r\n\r\n##### splitup option\r\nScore multiplier for modifying the score of a tag that got split up by space.\r\nThis enables you to decide whether to keep, lessen or ignore the 'base' tags.\r\n\r\nDefault `0.33`, Range `0.0 - 1.0`\r\n* `= 0.0` forget about the base tags\r\n* `< 1.0` reduce score of base tags\r\n* `= 1.0` leave score unmodified\r\n\r\n##### src_* options\r\nEvery source has its own score multiplier, so music sites that generally\r\nprovide higher quality tags can be given advantage over sources that often\r\nprovide bad, inaccurate or personal tags. Increase if you trust the tags from\r\na source, lower if the source provides many inaccurate or personal tags. If you\r\ndon't want tags from a specific source remove it from the sources list option.\r\n\r\nDefault `1.0`, Range `0.5 - 2.0`. See `sources` option above.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n```\r\nusage: whatlastgenre [-h] [-v] [-n] [-u] [-l N] [-r] [-i] [-d] path [path ...]\r\n\r\npositional arguments:\r\n  path                 directory(ies) to scan for albums\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help           show this help message and exit\r\n  -v, --verbose        verbose output (-vv for debug) (default: 0)\r\n  -n, --dry            don't save metadata (default: False)\r\n  -u, --update-cache   force cache update (default: False)\r\n  -l N, --tag-limit N  max. number of genre tags (default: 4)\r\n  -r, --tag-release    tag release type (from What.CD) (default: False)\r\n  -i, --interactive    interactive mode (default: False)\r\n  -d, --difflib        enable difflib matching (slow) (default: False)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you seriously want to tag releasetypes `-r` you should also enable\r\ninteractive mode `-i`. I recommend first doing a dry-run to fill the cache and\r\nthen doing a normal run with `-ri` enabled. This way you can choose the right\r\nresults without much waiting time in between. You can use `-r` without `-i` but\r\nmight get less releasetypes.\r\n\r\nRemove the cache file to reset the cache or use `-u` to force cache updates.\r\n\r\nDon't waste your time running `-n` and `-i` together.\r\n\r\nwhatlastgenre doesn't correct any other tags. If your music files are badly or\r\nnot tagged it won't work well at all.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\nDo a verbose dry-run on your albums in /media/music changing nothing:\r\n\r\n\twhatlastgenre -vn /media/music\r\n\r\nTag up to 3 genre tags for all albums in /media/music and /home/user/music:\r\n\r\n\twhatlastgenre -l 3 /media/music /home/user/music\r\n\r\nTag releasetypes and up to 4 genre tags for all albums in /media/music:\r\n\r\n\twhatlastgenre -ri /media/music\r\n\r\n\r\n## Plugins\r\n\r\nwhatlastgenre can be used in other software via plugins.\r\n\r\nAt the moment there is a [plugin for beets](plugin/beets).\r\n\r\nSee README files in the [plugin](plugin) directory for details.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Help / Debug\r\n\r\n#### Errors / Bugs / Crashes\r\nIf you encounter any strange errors (especially after updating to a later\r\nversion), please delete the cache file and try again with an empty cache\r\nbefore reporting it (do a backup first in case it doesn't solve the issue).\r\n\r\n#### Mediaplayers and file modification times\r\nSince file modification times are preserved, some players don't realize the\r\nchanged genre metadata automatically and might require some manual steps.\r\n\r\nfor example\r\n* mpd: needs rescan instead of normal update to get the mpd database updated.\r\n\r\n#### Debug tag handling / Improve tag results\r\nIn order to debug tag handling to improve the whitelist and tagsfile, you can\r\ndo a debug dry run and save the output to a logfile (adjust path):\r\n\r\n    whatlastgenre -nvv /media/music > /tmp/wlg.log\r\n\r\nThen search the logfile for specific lines:\r\n\r\n    grep ^tag /tmp/wlg.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -r | less\r\n\r\nUse the results to add missing whitelist entries, aliases or replaces.\r\n\r\nFeel free to share your improvements to the [data/*.txt](wlg/data) files or\r\nsend me your logfile so i can use it for debugging myself.\r\n\r\nAnother way to find possbile aliases is using the difflib `-d` argument.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease report any bugs and errors, i would like to fix them :)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
